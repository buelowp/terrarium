# Terrarium Control

The idea here is to provide a mechanism for controlling a small terrarium for plants that like humidity and warm. I'm doing this to control lights for a small planting of venus flytraps in my office. It provides a small bit of fun engineering for a simple mechanism.

## What's needed

1. WeMos D1 Mini (microcontroller)
1. 1.3 in OLED (Adafruit product id 938)
1. DHT22 (Temp and Humidity)
1. Soil Moisture Sensor (Sparkfun SEN-13322)
1. NeoPixel strip (Adafruit product id 1426)
1. UV LED 400nm (Sparkfun COM-08662)
1. 3v3 voltage regulator (Sparkfun COM-00526)
1. Power Supply (Sparkfun TOL-12889)
1. 1 x 470ohm 1/4 watt resistor
1. 2 x 1kohm 1/4 watt resistor
1. 1 x 10kohm 1/4 watt resistor
1. 2 x 2N3904 NPN Transistor (Sparkfun)
1. 1 x 100uf capacitor

## How to build it

The design is based on building a plastic terrarium from PVC and 3d printed parts. The 3d parts are a base and cap. There are 2 caps included, one that fits the OSH Park PCB, and one that would work with a standard breadboard solution. The 3d printed files include the .skp files if you want to make changes. The base contains the peat/soil, and the cap contains the electronics. The visible portion is 4 cut Plexi sheets (1/8 in) to fit the base and cap. These are fashioned into a box onto which the base and cap fit.

More to come.
